Data Shapley: Equitable Valuation of Data for Machine Learning
=====================================

Code for implementation of  ["Data Shapley: Equitable Valuation of Data for Machine Learning"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02868.pdf).


## Prerequisites

- Python, NumPy, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Basic Usage

To divide value fairly between individual train data points/sources given the learning algorithm and a meausre of performance for the trained model (test accuracy, etc)
